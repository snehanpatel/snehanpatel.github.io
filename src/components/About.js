                            Hi, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the <b>University of Waterloo</b>, 
                            on a mission to make a positive impact through technology. With a 
                            background in <b>full stack web development</b> and <b>backend software engineering</b>, 
                            I have developed a strong affinity for working with data and enhancing 
                            user productivity. I am also currently exploring ways to integrate AI 
                            into web applications and streamline work processes to create personalized 
                            user interactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Iâ€™m not in front of a screen, you can usually find me with a coffee 
                            or a book in hand. I also enjoy baking, hiking and exploring new places 
                            with my camera.
